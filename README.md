# pandas_python_selfnotes_byfaijahamed

I'm continuing my journey through the Simplilearn Python Libraries for Data Science course, and this week I focused on mastering Pandas—one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis and manipulation.

To practice what I learned, I created a self-notes repository on GitHub:
👉 [pandas_python_selfnotes_byfaijahamed](https://github.com/FaijAhamed-ML/pandas_python_selfnotes_byfaijahamed)

In this notebook, I walked through several practical Pandas use cases using real-world-style data examples from local markets such as “Maruthamunai Market,” “Koyambed Market,” and “Thiruvanmayoor Market.”

Here’s what I explored step by step:

Importing and checking Pandas and NumPy versions

Creating and manipulating Series and DataFrames

Accessing rows, columns, and specific elements using loc and iloc

Handling missing data with isna(), fillna(), and dropna()

Adding, removing, and updating columns efficiently

Applying lambda functions to transform columns dynamically

Performing groupby aggregation for data summarization

Demonstrating merge and concat operations (inner, outer, left, right joins)

Reading data directly from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames

Each step helped me understand how Pandas simplifies data cleaning and preprocessing—core skills for every aspiring data analyst or data scientist.

I’ll keep expanding this repository as I practice more advanced data handling and visualization concepts.
